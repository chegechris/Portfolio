Welcome to the Fundamentals of Programming Languages Course
Course Description
The purpose of this course is to familiarize the learner with the core concepts underlying every programming language despite their numerous surface-level differences. The learner will obtain a deep understanding of different programming paradigms, syntax, semantics, and the importance of programming languages in software development through a combination of theoretical knowledge and relevant hands-on projects.

Course Overview
This course will introduce students to both high-level and low-level programming languages, giving students the chance to learn about a variety of languages and lay out the foundation for their subsequent programming aspirations. This course will provide you with a framework for understanding how to use language constructs effectively and how to develop proper and elegant programs; it is neither extremely theoretical nor only about programming specifics. You can develop deeper thinking skills by employing multiple languages instead of just one language's specific syntax. To develop durable, reusable, composable, and elegant programs, one must learn the importance of functional programming. Indeed, functional programming is the source of many of the most significant concepts in contemporary languages. Prepare to discover a new and elegant perspective on software and how to enjoy creating it.
